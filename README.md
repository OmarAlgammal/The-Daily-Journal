The Journal News App is a news reader app with a simple and amazing design, powered by Flutter. The
app uses the Clean Architecture pattern for its structure, with BLoC (Business Logic Component) for
state management, and SOLID principles to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase. The app also
integrates with an API to fetch news data and uses Firebase for user authentication and data
storage. Additionally, the app includes features like light and dark themes and supports multiple
languages.
